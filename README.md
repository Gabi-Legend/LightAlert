# LightAlert

## Description
LightAlert is a simple Arduino-based project that monitors ambient light levels using an analog input. When the light intensity goes above a preset threshold, an active buzzer is activated to provide an audible alert.

## Features
- Light level monitoring
- Audible alert using an active buzzer
- Adjustable threshold

## Hardware
- Arduino board
- Light sensor (e.g. LDR)
- Active buzzer
- Jumper wires

## Usage
Upload the code to the Arduino board and open the Serial Monitor to observe light level readings. The buzzer will activate automatically when the threshold is exceeded.

## Purpose
This project is intended for learning basic Arduino concepts such as analog input reading and digital output control.
